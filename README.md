Have you ever had a situation when you need to make a lot of calculations for recipe ?
Now, you don't need to do this!
You just have to:
1. Insert indegrients list
2. Tell for how much indegrients this recipe is
3. Tell how much you want to produce

Also you can:
1. Save it as .txt file
2. Open in a new tab and print it!

Have fun with cooking !
